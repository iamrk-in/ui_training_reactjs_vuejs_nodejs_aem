            <h1> A Template for Killer Website Content </h1>

            <p>Over the years of developing websites for clients, <strong> I’ve learned that the age-old adage, </strong> “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” can be a two-way street.</p>

            <p>Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy <i> (that we slaved over) </i> into an ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your battles.</p>

                <li>Florin (disambiguation), various coins</li>
                <li>Guilder, various coins also sometimes called "florin"</li>

            <p>In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives them a fighting chance to produce <u> effective <del> website content </del> that drives action </u>. Here is a template we like to use, and an explanation of what’s included.</p>
