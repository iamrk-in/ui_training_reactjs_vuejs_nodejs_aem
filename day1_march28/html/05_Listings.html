        <h1> A Template for Killer Website Content </h1>

        <p>Over the years of developing websites for clients, <strong> I’ve learned that the age-old adage, </strong>  <a href="#"> “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself, </a>” can be a two-way street.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy <i> (that we slaved over) </i> into an ineffective <a href="01_CreatingHtmlStructure.html"> “brochure site” </a> gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your battles.</p>
