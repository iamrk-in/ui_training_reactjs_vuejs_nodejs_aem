        <h1> 10 Personality Traits of Legendary Entrepreneurs </h1>

        <h5> Success begins by cultivating the mindset required to take risks and lead teams.</h5>

        <p>The most <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/305251" target="_blank"> successful people </a> benefit from a combination of luck and personal prowess. Luck in the sense that timing is often a factor when ideas catch fire, and personal prowess in the sense that successful people are capable of capitalizing on lucky timing.</p>

        <p>If you’re hoping to increase your personal or professional success, you can cultivate personality traits that will optimize your chances. Let’s take a look at 10 personality traits that have enabled magnates like Steve Jobs, Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Ma to achieve remarkable things.</p>

        <h3>1. Open-minded</h3>

        <p>In 1983, Apple released Lisa. It was one of the first computers to use a bitmapped graphical interface and mouse. In short, the device was a revolution that put Apple on the map as a company that was developing cutting-edge personal computers.</p>

        <p>As Walter Isaacson noted in his biography Steve Jobs, Jobs led a team hoping to rethink what a personal computer could be. Rather than develop a device that could contend with market leaders of the day, Jobs and his team approached the task of developing a new personal computer with an open mind.</p>

        <p>Refusing to simply stick with the status quo, they pushed boundaries and designed a product built to solve a pesky problem (the usability of personal computers).</p>

        <h3>2. Focused</h3>

        <p>When Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, he knew that his company would need to focus on a specific problem in order for his small business to make any headway. As a result, he originally focused his team on becoming the world’s largest online bookseller.</p>

        <p>The company worked on innovations that would improve customer experience as it related to ecommerce bookselling. During a 1999 interview with 60 Minutes, Bezos was asked about his desk. Though at the time Bezos was already a billionaire, the desk was made of an office door and taped-together 4x4s. Bezos replied that the desk was “a symbol to spend money on things that matter to customers.”</p>

        <p>Since the early days of Amazon, Bezos has focused himself and his company on customer satisfaction. As a result, Amazon has been able to properly prioritize projects while avoiding initiatives that distract from the company mission</p>
