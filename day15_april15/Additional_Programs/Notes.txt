-> Usage of Generators:
    1. Generators let us write a Cleaner Code while Writing Async., Tasks
    2. Provides an easy way to implement the Iterators
    3. It executes its code only when it is required
    4. Generators are memory efficient

-> Diff., between Map & Object:
    1. Map: 
        1. Maps can contain objects and other data types as keys
        2. Maps can be directly iterated and their value can be accessed
        3. The number of elements of a Map can be determined by size property
        4. Map performs better for programs that require the addition or removal of elements frequently 


    2. Object:
        1. Objects can only contain strings and symbols as keys
        2. Objects can iterated by accessing the keys
        3. The number of elements of an object needs to be determined manually
        4. Object does not perform well if the program requires the addition or removal of the elements 

-> Reflect or Reflection: 
    - the reflection is the ability of a program to manipulate variables, properties, and methods  of objects at runtime.
    - builtin methods: Object.keys(), Object.getOwnerPropertyDescription(),  etc., 
    - apply(), construct(), defineProperty(), etc.,
